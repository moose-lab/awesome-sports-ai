**A curated list of open-source sports AI tools, datasets, and models, alongside a factory of runnable prototypes.**

Enterprise sports AI is powerful, but most of it sits behind expensive data rights and vendor contracts. This repository serves as both a knowledge base to discover accessible tools, and an open-source incubator to decompose enterprise capabilities into smaller, runnable building blocks.

[`data/catalog.json`](data/catalog.json) remains the canonical source for categories, sport tags, AI capabilities, openness labels, tool records, and builder recipes.

Awesome Sports AI is a resource-type-first awesome list for Sports & AI builders who need high-signal tools, datasets, libraries, models, benchmarks, and runnable prototypes.

## Who This Is For

- Developers building sports AI apps, prototypes, datasets, and automation workflows.
- Analysts, coaches, editors, and operators looking for usable tools they can run or adapt.
- Tool users who want to find a working project, understand the inputs and outputs, and decide whether it fits their sport workflow.
- Contributors who want small, concrete issues that improve the catalog, prototypes, or docs.

## Quick Start for Builders

- Need runnable code? Start with [Open-Source Projects](#open-source-projects), especially [`llm-match-commentator`](prototypes/llm-match-commentator/), [`wnba-gravity-mapper`](prototypes/wnba-gravity-mapper/), and [`pickleball-court-mapper`](prototypes/pickleball-court-mapper/).
- Need a tool you can use or adapt today? Start with [Apps & Products](#apps--products), then check the matching open-source project or SDK category.
- Need raw material? Start with [Datasets/APIs/Feeds](#datasetsapisfeeds).
- Need implementation building blocks? Start with [Developer Libraries/SDKs](#developer-librariessdks) and [AI Models/Components](#ai-modelscomponents).
- Need evaluation references? Start with [Research Benchmarks](#research-benchmarks).
- Need event or demo context? Start with [Event Toolkits](#event-toolkits) and [Builder Paths & Scenarios](#builder-paths--scenarios).
- **Contribute:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) or pick a [`good first issue`](https://github.com/moose-lab/awesome-sports-ai/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Vibe-Coding Lookup Paths

Use these paths when you want to move from idea to working prototype quickly:

- Match commentary app: [`llm-match-commentator`](prototypes/llm-match-commentator/) + [OpenAI Whisper](#ai-modelscomponents) + [StatsBomb Open Data](#datasetsapisfeeds).
- Basketball spacing tool: [`wnba-gravity-mapper`](prototypes/wnba-gravity-mapper/) + [Metrica Sports Sample Data](#datasetsapisfeeds) + [sportypy](#developer-librariessdks).
- Court vision prototype: [`pickleball-court-mapper`](prototypes/pickleball-court-mapper/) + [OpenCV](#developer-librariessdks) + [Roboflow Sports](#ai-modelscomponents).
- Soccer analytics report: [StatsBomb Open Data](#datasetsapisfeeds) + [socceraction](#developer-librariessdks) + [mplsoccer](#developer-librariessdks).
- World Cup knockout tracker: [Competition Factory](#open-source-projects) + [Challonge API](#datasetsapisfeeds) + [World Cup 2026 assistant toolkit](docs/world-cup-2026-toolkit.md).

## Sports & AI Relevance Rule

Every entry should connect a sport-specific workflow to AI, data, automation, video, modeling, benchmarking, or developer infrastructure. Generic tools belong here only when they unlock a clear sports AI use case.

Open-source projects, open datasets, open APIs, reproducible research, and free developer paths should lead each category. Commercial systems can stay when they help builders understand the professional reference point, but they should be labeled `commercial-reference`.

## The Prototype Factory

The catalog is the shop window. [`/prototypes`](prototypes/) is the factory floor. These examples decompose professional sports AI capabilities into runnable mono-tools with local input and visible output.

| Prototype | Capability Replaced | Input -> Output |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **[llm-match-commentator](prototypes/llm-match-commentator/)** | Automated recap/commentary systems (e.g., Stats Perform) | Event stream -> Bilingual markdown commentary |
| **[wnba-gravity-mapper](prototypes/wnba-gravity-mapper/)** | Proprietary spacing and gravity metrics | Player positions -> Tactical attention heatmap |
| **[pickleball-court-mapper](prototypes/pickleball-court-mapper/)** | Proprietary court-calibration systems | Court image -> Mapped court geometry diagram |


**Start here:** run a prototype, inspect the output, then fork the smallest piece you want to improve.

## Builder Paths & Scenarios

If you are focused on a specific sport, check out our **[Browse by Sport Guides](docs/sports/)** (e.g., [Football](docs/sports/football.md), [Running](docs/sports/running.md), [HYROX](docs/sports/hyrox.md)) to see how tools can be combined for specific scenarios.

These paths show how catalog entries become prototype ideas:

- **Build your own xG model:** public shot data, event schema, shot-map renderer, baseline model, model card.

- **Build your own coaching video tagger:** clip cutter, event tagger, possession timeline, coach notes exporter, highlight captioner.

- **Build your own scouting board:** player profile schema, public data loader, similarity radar, searchable clip index, scouting report template.

- **Build your own athlete load dashboard:** wearable CSV parser, team ID resolver, workload ratio, risk flags, weekly dashboard.

- **Build your own match intelligence report:** fixture normalizer, match-event schema, win-probability lite, stat-card generator, match-report markdown.


See [Enterprise-to-Open-Source Decomposition](docs/enterprise-to-open-source-decomposition.md) for the broader stack map and [2026 Strategic Roadmap](docs/roadmap-2026-strategy.md) for the next prototype lanes.
