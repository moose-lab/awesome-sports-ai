## Congratulations, New York Knicks: 2026 NBA Champions!

The Knicks closed the 2026 NBA Finals 4-1 over the San Antonio Spurs with a 94-90 Game 5 win on June 13, 2026, ending a 53-year championship wait.

## Sport Tags

Entries are grouped by use case and tagged by sport so contributors can keep one canonical placement while still making sport-specific tools easy to find.

V1 sport tags: `Soccer`, `Basketball`, `American Football`, `Baseball/Softball`, `Tennis/Racquet`, `Running/Track`, `Cycling`, `Swimming`, `Ice Hockey`, `Rugby`, `Cricket`, `Volleyball`, `Golf`, `Combat Sports`, `Motorsport`, `Esports`, `Multi-sport`.

Use `Multi-sport` for tools designed to work across many sports, generic APIs, infrastructure, visualization libraries, video tooling, and datasets not tied to one sport.

Example entry tags:

- [Example Basketball Tool](https://example.com) - Clear one-sentence description. _Sports: Basketball._
- [Example Match Analytics Tool](https://example.com) - Clear one-sentence description. _Sports: Soccer, Basketball._
- [Example Sports API](https://example.com) - Clear one-sentence description. _Sports: Multi-sport._

## Enterprise-to-Open-Source Decomposition

Professional sports teams use expensive AI, video, tracking, scouting, and athlete-performance systems that are hard for individual builders to access. This repository decomposes those enterprise capabilities into small mono-tools the open-source community can build.

See the [Enterprise-to-Open-Source Decomposition roadmap](docs/enterprise-to-open-source-decomposition.md) for the stack map and development roadmap.

## 2026 Strategic Roadmap

The sports AI industry is rapidly evolving, with a projected market size of nearly $50 billion by 2033. To align with the hottest trends of 2026—including the FIFA World Cup, the explosion of Women's Sports, Multimodal LLMs, and emerging sports like Pickleball and Esports—we have published the [2026 Strategic Roadmap](docs/roadmap-2026-strategy.md). 

This roadmap outlines high-profile, early-stage open-source projects that developers can start building today to capitalize on these trends.
